Layout

The calculator is centered on the screen with a simple, clean layout.

The calculator keypad is arranged in a standard 4x4 grid layout. <hr>

There is a display area at the top to show the input and results.

Color Scheme

The design uses a muted color scheme with grays, whites, and blues to create a modern,
 minimalist aesthetic.
The number keys are a light gray, while the operation keys are a slightly darker gray.

The "equals" key is highlighted in blue to draw the user's attention.
Typography

The calculator uses a clear, readable sans-serif font for the number and operation labels.
The display area uses a larger font size to make the results easy to read.
Interactivity

The calculator keys are designed to provide visual feedback when pressed, either through a change in color or a slight shadow effect.
The display area updates in real-time as the user enters numbers and operations.
